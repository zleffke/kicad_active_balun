\label{sec:general_introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{subsec:purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the initial design of an active HF dipole antenna. This document is intended to provide the initial design decisions that went into the development of this antenna system.  While the full antenna wil eventually be discussed, this document will primarily discuss the development and test of the core Printed Circuit Board (PCB) developed for the project. 

\subsection{Scope}
\label{subsec:scope}
As an initial design document, the scope of this document may be fairly broad.  The primary focus will be on the development of the core PCB active dipole balun board.  The document may also include test procedures, test results,  antenna performance on air, and other areas as necessary.
