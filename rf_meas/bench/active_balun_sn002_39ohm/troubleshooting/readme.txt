explains lack of gain with on air performance
When originally set up, orthogonal to sn001, had weaker signals on air.
ORginally thought it might be the Gali-74s.  replaced Gali-74s, no change.
tried low pass signal path, all looked good, which lead to inspection of bpf.
compared resistance to sn003, discovered problems with 4.7uH inductors.
replaced inductors, all is well. have pictures of bad inductors....solder beads on wire.
All measurements after fix.
